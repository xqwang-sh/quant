title: "Project 1: Factor Investing Strategy Construction"
---

# Project Background

Factor investing is one of the core methods in modern quantitative investing. Its theoretical foundation can be traced back to the Fama-French three-factor model. This model extended the traditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) by introducing the size factor (SMB) and the value factor (HML) to better explain the cross-sectional differences in stock returns. As research has deepened, scholars have discovered various other characteristic factors that can generate excess returns, such as momentum, quality, and low volatility factors.

Traditional factor investing strategies are typically based on financial indicators, market data, or other observable company characteristics to construct portfolios that capture the risk premia associated with specific factors. Successful factor investing requires a deep understanding of the economic rationale behind factors, their statistical properties, and the constraints in practical application.

In this project, you will have the opportunity to apply your theoretical knowledge of quantitative finance to design and implement your own factor investing strategy, and to evaluate its effectiveness through rigorous statistical tests and backtesting.

# Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is for you to design and implement an investment strategy based on a specific factor that can generate significant excess returns over the expectations of the Chinese version of the three-factor model. Specific objectives include:

1.  **Factor Design**: Based on financial data, market data, or alternative data, design a factor with a sound economic rationale.
2.  **Factor Testing**: Validate the effectiveness of the factor through methods such as cross-sectional regression or portfolio sort tests.
3.  **Portfolio Construction**: Construct long-short portfolios or long-only enhanced portfolios based on factor values.
4.  **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio, especially its alpha contribution relative to the Chinese version of the three-factor model.
5.  **Robustness Checks**: Conduct out-of-sample tests, sub-sample tests, or other robustness checks to verify the persistence of the factor effect.

# Data Requirements

You can obtain the following data from the CSMAR or WIND databases for your analysis:

1.  **Stock Price Data**: Use historical price data for Chinese A-shares.
2.  **Financial Data**: Quarterly or annual financial statement data.
3.  **Macroeconomic Data**: If necessary, relevant macroeconomic indicators can be incorporated.
