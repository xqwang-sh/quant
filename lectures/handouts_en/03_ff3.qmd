## Theoretical Foundations of Multi-Factor Models

### From CAPM to Multi-Factor Models

While the CAPM, as a single-factor model, is structurally simple, it faces numerous challenges in empirical tests. The emergence of multi-factor models is a natural extension of the CAPM, aiming to address market anomalies and sources of risk premium that the single-factor model cannot explain.

-   **Review of CAPM Limitations**:
    -   Considers only market risk as a single type of systematic risk.
    -   Fails to explain market anomalies such as the size effect and value effect.
    -   Empirical tests often show Alpha to be significantly non-zero.

-   **Basic Idea of Multi-Factor Models**:
    -   **Diversified Sources of Risk**: Assumes that asset returns are influenced by multiple systematic risk factors, not just market risk.
    -   **Expanded Sources of Risk Premium**: The risk premium demanded by investors comes from compensation for bearing multiple systematic risks.
    -   **Better Explanatory Power**: Aims to improve the model's ability to explain cross-sectional differences in asset returns by introducing more risk factors.

### General Form of Multi-Factor Models

Multi-factor models typically adopt the following linear form:

$$R_i - R_f = \alpha_i + \beta_{i,1}F_1 + \beta_{i,2}F_2 + ... + \beta_{i,K}F_K + \epsilon_i$$

Where:
- $R_i - R_f$: Excess return of asset $i$.
- $\alpha_i$: Intercept term; theoretically should be zero if the model is accurate.
- $\beta_{i,k}$: Sensitivity of asset $i$ to risk factor $k$.
- $F_k$: Risk premium of the $k$-th risk factor.
- $\epsilon_i$: Asset-specific unsystematic risk, i.e., the residual term.

### Types of Multi-Factor Models

-   **Economic Theory-Driven Multi-Factor Models**:
    -   Risk factors derived from economic theory.
    -   Examples: Ross's (1976) Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), Merton's (1973) Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM).
    -   Advantage: Solid theoretical foundation; Disadvantage: Difficult to determine specific risk factors.

-   **Statistical Technique-Driven Multi-Factor Models**:
    -   Use statistical methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract common factors from data.
    -   Example: Chen, Roll and Ross's (1986) macroeconomic factor model.
    -   Advantage: High data fitting degree; Disadvantage: Factors may lack clear economic meaning.

-   **Anomaly-Driven Multi-Factor Models**:
    -   Factors constructed based on observed market anomalies.
    -   Examples: Fama-French Three-Factor Model, Carhart Four-Factor Model.
    -   Advantage: Directly addresses known market anomalies; Disadvantage: Potential risk of overfitting.

## Construction of the Fama-French Three-Factor Model

### Background of the Three-Factor Model's Introduction

-   **Challenge of Market Anomalies**:
    -   In the 1980s and 1990s, scholars discovered many market anomalies that CAPM could not explain.
    -   The most significant were the **size effect** (small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks) and the **value effect** (high book-to-market ratio stocks outperform low book-to-market ratio stocks).

-   **Contribution of Fama and French**:
    -   In 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French published the famous paper "The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns."
    -   In 1993, they further published "Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds," formally proposing the three-factor model.
    -   They introduced size and value into asset pricing models, constructing the influential three-factor model.

### Mathematical Expression of the Three-Factor Model

The mathematical expression of the Fama-French Three-Factor Model is as follows:

$$R_i - R_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i(R_m - R_f) + s_i \cdot SMB + h_i \cdot HML + \epsilon_i$$

Where:
- $R_i - R_f$: Excess return of asset $i$.
- $R_m - R_f$: Excess return of the market portfolio (market factor).
- $SMB$: Size factor (Small Minus Big), the return difference between small-cap stocks and large-cap stocks.
- $HML$: Value factor (High Minus Low), the return difference between high book-to-market ratio stocks and low book-to-market ratio stocks.
- $\beta_i$, $s_i$, $h_i$: Sensitivities of asset $i$ to the three factors, respectively.
- $\alpha_i$: Intercept term, representing the unexplained excess return.
- $\epsilon_i$: Residual term.

### SMB Factor Construction Method

SMB (Small Minus Big) is the factor measuring the size effect, representing the excess return of small-cap stocks relative to large-cap stocks.

-   **Grouping Steps**:
    1.  **Size Division**: All stocks are divided into two groups based on market capitalization:
        -   Small-cap group (S): Stocks with market capitalization below the median.
        -   Large-cap group (B): Stocks with market capitalization above the median.

    2.  **Book-to-Market Ratio Division**: Stocks are divided into three groups based on their book-to-market ratio (B/M):
        -   Low B/M group (L): Stocks in the lowest 30% of B/M ratios.
        -   Medium B/M group (M): Stocks in the middle 40% of B/M ratios.
        -   High B/M group (H): Stocks in the highest 30% of B/M ratios.

    3.  **Formation of Six Portfolios**: The two classifications above are intersected to form six portfolios:
        -   Small-cap/Low B/M (S/L)
        -   Small-cap/Medium B/M (S/M)
        -   Small-cap/High B/M (S/H)
        -   Large-cap/Low B/M (B/L)
        -   Large-cap/Medium B/M (B/M)
        -   Large-cap/High B/M (B/H)

-   **SMB Calculation Formula**:
    $$SMB = \frac{1}{3}[(S/L - B/L) + (S/M - B/M) + (S/H - B/H)]$$

    This is the average return of the small-cap portfolios minus the average return of the large-cap portfolios.

### HML Factor Construction Method

HML (High Minus Low) is the factor measuring the value effect, representing the excess return of high book-to-market ratio stocks relative to low book-to-market ratio stocks.

-   **Using the Same Six Portfolios**:

-   **HML Calculation Formula**:
    $$HML = \frac{1}{2}[(S/H - S/L) + (B/H - B/L)]$$

    This is the average return of the high B/M portfolios minus the average return of the low B/M portfolios.

### Practical Considerations for Factor Construction

-   **Rebalancing Frequency**: Portfolios are typically rebalanced annually or semi-annually.
-   **Financial Data Lag**: Use book value data from the end of the previous fiscal year to ensure data availability.
-   **Outlier Treatment**: Exclude stocks with negative book values and handle extreme values.
-   **Market Capitalization Calculation**: Typically use free-float market capitalization rather than total market capitalization to reflect the actually tradable portion.

## Economic Interpretation of the Three-Factor Model

### Economic Interpretation of the Market Factor ($R_m - R_f$)

-   **Inherited from CAPM**: The market factor represents overall market risk, identical to the market risk in the CAPM.
-   **Compensation for Systematic Risk**: Measures the risk premium investors demand for bearing overall market risk.
-   **Non-Diversifiability**: Represents systematic risk that cannot be eliminated through diversification.

### Economic Interpretation of the Size Factor (SMB)

Fama and French argue that the SMB factor represents the additional systematic risk borne by small-cap companies:

-   **Economic Fragility Hypothesis**: Small-cap companies are more vulnerable to economic recessions and perform worse during difficult economic times.
-   **Information Asymmetry Hypothesis**: Small-cap companies have lower information transparency, and investors bear higher information risk.
-   **Liquidity Risk Hypothesis**: Small-cap stocks have poorer liquidity, and investors demand an additional liquidity premium.
-   **Financial Distress Hypothesis**: Small-cap companies are more prone to financial distress and bankruptcy risk.

### Economic Interpretation of the Value Factor (HML)

The HML factor represents the additional systematic risk borne by high B/M companies:

-   **Financial Distress Risk Hypothesis**: High B/M companies often have poorer financial health and face higher default risk.
-   **Growth Opportunities Hypothesis**: High B/M companies typically lack growth opportunities and are more vulnerable during economic downturns.
-   **Earnings Persistence Hypothesis**: The profitability of high B/M companies is often weaker or more volatile, with poorer persistence.
-   **Investor Sentiment Hypothesis**: Investors tend to be overly optimistic about growth companies, leading to undervaluation of value companies.

### Interpretation from a Behavioral Finance Perspective

Behavioral finance offers explanations different from rational risk pricing:

-   **Overreaction Hypothesis**: Investors overreact to companies' short-term performance, leading to undervaluation of value stocks and overvaluation of growth stocks.
-   **Investor Sentiment**: Investors prefer growth stocks and are willing to pay an extra premium for growth expectations.
-   **Lottery Preference**: Investors prefer small-cap growth stocks with lottery-like characteristics.
-   **Attention Effect**: Large-cap companies receive more attention, and their pricing may be more efficient.

## Empirical Testing of the Three-Factor Model

### Classic Test Results in the U.S. Market

Key findings from Fama and French's original papers:

-   **Significantly Improved Explanatory Power**: Compared to CAPM, the three-factor model explains more of the cross-sectional variation in stock returns.
-   **Capture of the Size Effect**: The model successfully explains the excess returns of small-cap stocks.
-   **Capture of the Value Effect**: The model successfully explains the excess returns of high B/M stocks.
-   **Strong Statistical Significance**: The risk premiums for the three factors are statistically significantly different from zero.
-   **Time Stability**: Factor risk premiums exhibit relative stability across different periods.

### Main Empirical Methods

-   **Time-Series Regression**:
    -   Perform time-series regression for individual assets or portfolios.
    -   Test whether factor sensitivities ($\beta$, $s$, $h$) are significant and whether the intercept $\alpha$ approaches zero.

-   **Cross-Sectional Regression**:
    -   Use Fama-MacBeth regression to test if factor risk premiums are significant.
    -   Test whether the three-factor model can explain the cross-sectional differences in asset returns.

-   **Portfolio Analysis**:
    -   Construct portfolios with different characteristics to test the explanatory power of the three-factor model.
    -   Often uses size-value sorted portfolios (e.g., 25 portfolios) formed by independent sorting.

### Findings from Subsequent Research

-   **Robustness**: The three-factor model has shown good robustness across different markets and periods.
-   **Scope of Applicability**: The model is not only applicable to the stock market but can also be extended to bonds and other asset classes.
-   **Further Market Anomalies**: Research has identified anomalies that the three-factor model still cannot explain, such as the momentum effect and profitability effect.
-   **Model Extensions**: Spurred the development of more complex models like the four-factor and five-factor models.

## Variations of the Three-Factor Model in the Chinese Market

### Characteristics of the Chinese Market and Applicability of the Three-Factor Model

The Chinese stock market has unique characteristics that affect the applicability of the three-factor model:

-   **Emerging Market Characteristics**: As an emerging market, China has relatively lower market efficiency and stronger speculative behavior.
-   **Government Intervention**: Government policies have a significant impact on the market, creating unique sources of risk.
-   **Investor Structure**: An investor structure dominated by retail investors leads to more pronounced behavioral biases.
-   **Special Institutional Arrangements**: Such as the split-share structure reform and price limit mechanisms.
-   **Market Segmentation between A-shares and H-shares**: Significant pricing differences for the same company in A-share and H-share markets reflect market segmentation effects.
-   **Trading Restriction Factors**: Including short-selling restrictions and daily price limit systems, which affect factor performance.

### Empirical Research on Size and Value Factors in the Chinese Market

According to the study "Size and Value in China" by Liu, Stambaugh, and Yuan (2019), size and value factors in the Chinese market exhibit some unique characteristics requiring special treatment:

-   **Shell Value Distortion in Small-Cap Stocks**:
    -   The smallest 30% of stocks in the Chinese market have a significant shell value problem, where prices reflect the potential value of being used as a shell company for reverse mergers.
    -   Reverse mergers provide a backdoor listing route for private enterprises, bypassing cumbersome IPO approval processes.
    -   The returns of small-cap stocks are significantly affected by changes in shell value rather than traditional risk factors.

-   **China-Specific Three-Factor Model (CH-3)**:
    -   To address the characteristics of the Chinese market, a size factor (SMC) was constructed excluding the smallest 30% of market-cap stocks.
    -   An earnings-to-price ratio (E/P) was used instead of book-to-market ratio (B/M) to construct the value factor (VMG), as it performs better in the Chinese market.
    -   The CH-3 model (composed of the market factor, SMC, and VMG) significantly outperforms the traditional FF-3 model.

-   **Superior Explanatory Power**:
    -   The CH-3 model can explain 8 out of 10 common anomalies in the Chinese market.
    -   In contrast, the traditional FF-3 model can only explain 3 anomalies.
    -   Bayesian tests show that the CH-3 model is significantly superior to the FF-3 model in explaining factor performance.

### Latest Findings from Empirical Tests in the Chinese Market

Based on the research by Liu, Stambaugh, and Yuan (2019) and other empirical results from Chinese scholars, the advantages of the CH-3 model over the traditional model are evident in:

-   **Performance of the Adjusted Size Factor**:
    -   After excluding the smallest 30% of market-cap stocks, the size effect becomes more robust and predictable.
    -   The risk premium of the adjusted size factor (SMC) is significant and stable.
    -   The smallest market-cap group of stocks exhibits return patterns significantly different from other size groups, consistent with the shell value hypothesis.
    -   The size effect in large and mid-cap stocks more accurately reflects true risk premiums.

-   **Optimization of Value Factor Selection**:
    -   E/P (inverse of price-to-earnings ratio) as a value metric performs significantly better than B/M in the Chinese market.
    -   The value factor (VMG) better captures information about profitability and growth opportunities.
    -   The adjusted value factor has a closer connection to the macroeconomy.
    -   The value factor performs more robustly in samples that exclude very small-cap stocks.

-   **Interrelationships Between Factors**:
    -   The correlation between the adjusted size factor and value factor is lower, providing better diversification benefits.
    -   The factor portfolios corresponding to the three factors in the CH-3 model exhibit lower correlations.
    -   Unlike the U.S. market, small market capitalization and high value are not always positively correlated in the Chinese market.
    -   Economic cycles and policy environments significantly impact factor correlations.

-   **Anomaly Explanation Capability**:
    -   The CH-3 model can explain most market anomalies in China, including:
        -   Profitability anomaly
        -   Volatility anomaly
        -   Reversal effect
        -   ...
    -   The model's explanatory power is further enhanced in samples excluding the smallest 30% of market-cap stocks.
    -   Bayesian analysis shows CH-3 outperforms FF-3 in various scenarios.

### Special Considerations for Practical Application of the Three-Factor Model in the Chinese Market

Based on the findings of Liu et al. (2019) and domestic empirical research, the following special factors need to be considered when applying the three-factor model in the Chinese market:

-   **Adjustment in Size Factor Construction**:
    -   The smallest 30% of stocks by market capitalization should be excluded to avoid interference from the shell value effect.
    -   Use SMC (Excluding Small) instead of the traditional SMB to improve the risk explanation power of the size factor.
    -   Consider using asymmetric partitioning for size grouping (e.g., 30%-70%), which may better suit the size distribution characteristics of the Chinese market.

-   **Choice of Value Factor Indicator**:
    -   E/P (inverse of P/E ratio) performs better than the traditional B/M in the Chinese market.
    -   Construct a VMG (Value Minus Growth) value factor to replace the traditional HML.
    -   Exclude companies with negative earnings or use composite value indicators to improve stability.

-   **Consideration of Reverse Mergers and Institutional Factors**:
    -   Pay attention to the dynamic impact of changes in the value of shell resources due to policy shifts.
    -   Monitor abnormal return fluctuations of small-cap stocks, especially during periods of regulatory policy adjustments.
    -   Consider incorporating changes in shell value as an additional risk factor in the model.

-   **Data Quality and Frequency Selection**:
    -   Address data quality issues in the Chinese market, especially the reliability of early data and financial reports.
    -   Consider using quarterly rather than monthly frequency to construct more robust factors.
    -   Test across multiple sample periods, paying attention to model performance differences before and after market institutional reforms.

## Summary

- The Fama-French Three-Factor Model significantly improved the explanation of cross-sectional differences in stock returns by introducing the size factor (SMB) and the value factor (HML).
- Each factor in the three-factor model has its economic interpretation and can be seen as compensation for specific systematic risks.
- In the Chinese market, the traditional three-factor model needs adjustments according to China's market characteristics. The CH-3 model proposed by Liu et al. (2019) (using SMC, a size factor excluding the smallest stocks, and VMG, a value factor based on E/P) significantly outperforms the traditional FF-3 model.
- The shell value effect in the Chinese market is a key factor in the pricing of small-cap stocks and should be given special consideration when constructing factors and applying models.
- The framework of multi-factor models has laid the foundation for the development of subsequent asset pricing models, and each market may require model adjustments based on its unique institutional environment and market characteristics.
