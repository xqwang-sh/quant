### Application Process of Alternative Data in Factor Investing

1.  **Data Acquisition and Cleaning:**
    * Establish data collection channels (direct collection or third-party purchase).
    * Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize formats.
    * Automate data updates.
2.  **Signal Extraction and Factor Construction:**
    * Apply statistical techniques to extract effective signals from raw data.
    * Transform signals into quantifiable investment factors.
    * Control factor noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
3.  **Factor Testing and Evaluation:**
    * Conduct historical backtesting to analyze predictive power.
    * Test the incremental contribution of the factor relative to traditional factors.
    * Assess factor stability and decay speed.
4.  **Portfolio Integration:**
    * Integrate new factors into existing multi-factor models.
    * Determine optimal weights or risk budgets.
    * Monitor factor performance and dynamically adjust.

### Challenges and Solution Strategies for Alternative Data Application

* **Main Challenges:**
    1.  **Technology and Data Must Match:** Processing complex/unstructured data requires advanced techniques like NLP, computer vision, deep learning, etc.; high-dimensional data can lead to the curse of dimensionality and overfitting risks; attention must be paid to multiple hypothesis testing issues.
        * **Case Study:** Traditional analytical techniques struggle with satellite image data; specialized computer vision models are needed to extract effective parking lot vehicle counts from raw images.
    2.  **Domain Knowledge is Required:** Understanding the context of data generation, business processes, and financial implications is key; otherwise, value cannot be effectively mined. Relying on third-party processed data may result in a loss of uniqueness and timeliness.
        * **Case Study:** Relying solely on statistical correlations when analyzing social media data can lead to misjudgments; industry knowledge is needed to understand if a brand mention is a positive review or a negative complaint.
    3.  **Data Bias:** Vigilance is needed against biases in the data collection process (e.g., selection bias, survivorship bias, geographical bias) to ensure the data represents the overall population.
        * **Case Study:** Glassdoor employee reviews might overrepresent dissatisfied employees; credit card data might be skewed towards the consumption behavior of middle-to-high-income groups.
    4.  **Short Historical Sample Data:** Most alternative data has a short history (often <5 years), exacerbating overfitting risks and making long-term robustness testing difficult.
        * **Case Study:** Social media sentiment data typically only has a few years of history, making it impossible to validate its performance across different market cycles.
    5.  **Testing Incremental Contribution:** It's necessary to verify whether alternative data factors can provide **incremental** information and returns beyond traditional factors, avoiding the "old wine in a new bottle" scenario.
        * **Case Study:** Some consumer data might only provide signals similar to publicly available retail sales data, offering no substantial incremental value.

* **Effective Utilization Strategies:**
    1.  **Start with Business Hypotheses:** First, establish reasonable business hypotheses, then find corresponding data for validation to avoid blind data mining.
    2.  **Value Chain Perspective:** Think about potential alternative data monitoring points from the perspective of a company's entire value chain.
    3.  **Combined Use:** Signals from a single data source can be weak; combining multiple data sources can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
    4.  **Prioritize Timeliness:** Give priority to alternative data that can offer timeliness unachievable by traditional data.
    5.  **Build a Data Moat:** Establish proprietary data sources or analytical methods that are difficult to replicate.

### Prospects for Alternative Data Application

The potential is enormous, but challenges must be objectively recognized, and use should be cautious, combining professional knowledge with scientific methods. As data acquisition costs decrease and processing technologies advance, alternative data is likely to become an important source of future excess returns for institutional investors. Leading hedge funds and asset management firms have already established dedicated alternative data teams, and this trend is expected to continue expanding to a broader range of investment institutions.
