## Theoretical Foundations of the CAPM Model

### Why Study the CAPM Model?

-   **Cornerstone of Modern Financial Theory**: The CAPM model is the starting point of modern financial theory. Understanding CAPM is a necessary foundation for learning more advanced models.
-   **Risk and Return Pricing Model**: The CAPM model provides a concise framework for understanding the relationship between risk and expected return, making it one of the core models for asset pricing.
-   **Important Tool for Investment Decisions**: The CAPM model can help investors assess the fair rate of return for assets, conduct portfolio management, and evaluate performance.
-   **Widespread Academic Research and Practical Application**: The CAPM model is extensively used in both academic research and investment practice, making it essential knowledge for finance professionals.

### Core Assumptions of the CAPM Model

The CAPM model is built upon a series of idealized assumptions. Understanding these assumptions is key to understanding the model's applicability and limitations.

-   **Investors are risk-averse and seek to maximize utility**:
    -   Given a certain level of return, investors prefer investments with lower risk; given a certain level of risk, investors prefer investments with higher returns.
    -   The goal of investors' decision-making is to maximize their expected utility, not just expected return.

-   **Markets are perfect**:
    -   **No transaction costs**: There are no transaction fees, such as commissions or taxes, for buying or selling assets.
    -   **Symmetric information**: All investors have free and timely access to all relevant information.
    -   **Perfect divisibility**: Assets can be infinitely divided, and investors can buy or sell any quantity of an asset.
    -   **No short-selling restrictions**: Investors can short-sell any asset without limitation.

-   **A risk-free rate exists, and investors can borrow and lend unlimitedly at this rate**:
    -   A risk-free rate $R_f$ exists, at which investors can borrow or lend funds without limit.
    -   This implies that investors can freely adjust the risk level of their portfolios.

-   **All investors have the same investment horizon**:
    -   All investors have the same investment horizon, e.g., one month, one year, etc.
    -   This simplifies model analysis, allowing us to focus on single-period investment decisions.

-   **Asset returns are normally distributed**:
    -   The returns of all assets follow a normal distribution.
    -   The assumption of normality allows us to fully describe the distribution characteristics of returns using mean and variance, simplifying risk measurement.

### Interpretation of Core Assumptions

-   **Idealized Assumptions vs. Reality**: The assumptions of the CAPM model are rarely fully met in real markets; for example, transaction costs exist, and information is not perfectly symmetric.
-   **Model Simplification and Trade-offs**: These assumptions are simplifications of reality, aimed at constructing a concise and analyzable model. The model's value lies in providing a basic framework for understanding asset pricing, not in perfectly predicting reality.
-   **Extensions in Subsequent Models**: Subsequent asset pricing models, such as the Fama-French Three-Factor Model and behavioral finance models, have been developed by relaxing some of the CAPM model's assumptions.

## Derivation of the CAPM Model

### Review of Portfolio Theory: Mean-Variance Analysis Framework

The derivation of the CAPM model is based on Markowitz's portfolio theory. We first review the mean-variance analysis framework.

-   **Expected Return**:
    -   The expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the expected returns of the assets in the portfolio:
        $E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)$
        where $w_i$ is the weight of asset $i$ in the portfolio, and $E(R_i)$ is the expected return of asset $i$.

-   **Portfolio Variance**:
    -   The variance of a portfolio (measuring risk) depends not only on the variances of individual assets but also on the covariances between assets:
        $\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}$
        where $\sigma_{ij}$ is the covariance between the returns of asset $i$ and asset $j$.

-   **Efficient Frontier**:
    -   In the mean-variance framework, rational investors will seek portfolios on the **efficient frontier**.
    -   The **efficient frontier** is the set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk, or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.

### Introducing the Risk-Free Asset: Capital Market Line (CML)

The CAPM model builds upon portfolio theory by introducing a risk-free asset and assuming that all investors hold the same efficient frontier.

-   **Characteristics of the Risk-Free Asset**:
    -   Expected return: $E(R_f) = R_f$ (risk-free rate)
    -   Standard deviation: $\sigma_f = 0$ (risk-free)
    -   Covariance with any risky asset: $\sigma_{if} = 0$

-   **Derivation of the Capital Market Line (CML)**:
    -   When a risk-free asset is introduced, investors can invest their funds in a linear combination of the risk-free asset and the **market portfolio** $M$.
    -   The **market portfolio** $M$ is a portfolio of all risky assets, where the weight of each asset is proportional to its total market capitalization. (In the CAPM model, the market portfolio itself lies on the efficient frontier).
    -   The **Capital Market Line (CML)** describes how the efficient frontier changes from a curve to a straight line:
        $E(R_p) = R_f + \frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m} \sigma_p$
        where $E(R_m)$ and $\sigma_m$ are the expected return and standard deviation of the market portfolio $M$, respectively.

-   **Economic Meaning of the CML**:
    -   The CML indicates that in an efficient market, investors can achieve the optimal risk-return combination for any level of risk by allocating funds between the risk-free asset and the market portfolio.
    -   The slope of the CML, $\frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m}$, is called the **price of risk for the market risk premium**, representing the excess return achievable per unit of risk (standard deviation).

### Derivation of the Security Market Line (SML): The Core of the CAPM Model

The CML describes the pricing relationship for efficient portfolios, while the **Security Market Line (SML)** further defines the relationship between the expected return and risk for **individual assets**, which is the core of the CAPM model.

-   **Systematic Risk and Unsystematic Risk**:
    -   **Total Risk**: Can be measured by standard deviation $\sigma_i$.
    -   **Systematic Risk**: Also known as market risk or non-diversifiable risk, refers to common risk factors affecting all assets, such as macroeconomic factors, policy changes, etc.
    -   **Unsystematic Risk**: Also known as specific risk or diversifiable risk, refers to risk factors affecting only individual assets, such as company management, industry competition, etc.

-   **Beta Coefficient ($\beta_i$): Measure of Systematic Risk**:
    -   In the CAPM model, the **Beta coefficient** ($\beta_i$) is used to measure the systematic risk of asset $i$.
    -   $\beta_i$ is defined as the covariance of asset $i$'s return with the market portfolio's return, divided by the variance of the market portfolio's return:
        $\beta_i = \frac{Cov(R_i, R_m)}{Var(R_m)}$
    -   $\beta_i$ measures the sensitivity of asset $i$'s return to changes in the market portfolio's return.
        -   $\beta_i > 1$: Asset $i$ is more volatile than the market portfolio; higher systematic risk.
        -   $\beta_i = 1$: Asset $i$'s volatility is synchronized with the market portfolio.
        -   $\beta_i < 1$: Asset $i$ is less volatile than the market portfolio; lower systematic risk.
        -   $\beta_i < 0$: Asset $i$ moves in the opposite direction to the market portfolio, potentially hedging market risk.

-   **Formula of the Security Market Line (SML)**:
    -   The core formula of the CAPM model describes the linear relationship between an individual asset's expected return and its Beta coefficient:
        $E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i[E(R_m) - R_f]$
    -   Where:
        -   $E(R_i)$: Expected return of asset $i$
        -   $R_f$: Risk-free rate
        -   $\beta_i$: Beta coefficient of asset $i$
        -   $E(R_m)$: Expected return of the market portfolio
        -   $[E(R_m) - R_f]$: **Market Risk Premium**, the excess return investors demand for investing in the market portfolio relative to the risk-free asset.

-   **Economic Meaning of the SML**:
    -   The SML indicates that, under the CAPM, **only systematic risk is priced**. Unsystematic risk can be eliminated through diversification, so investors do not require a risk premium for bearing unsystematic risk.
    -   An asset's expected return is related only to its systematic risk ($\beta_i$); the higher the $\beta_i$, the higher the expected return.
    -   The SML provides a benchmark for asset pricing and can be used to assess whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued.

## Calculation and Economic Interpretation of the Beta Coefficient

### Methods for Calculating Beta Coefficient

-   **Definition Method**:
    -   Directly calculate using the definition formula for Beta:
        $\beta_i = \frac{Cov(R_i, R_m)}{Var(R_m)}$
    -   This requires calculating the return series for asset $i$ and the market portfolio $m$, then computing their covariance and the variance of the market return.

-   **Regression Method**:
    -   A more common method is to estimate the Beta coefficient using a regression model.
    -   **Market Model**:
        $R_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i R_{m,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}$
        Where $R_{i,t}$ and $R_{m,t}$ are the returns of asset $i$ and the market portfolio in period $t$, respectively, and $\epsilon_{i,t}$ is the error term.
        By regressing the market model, an estimate of $\beta_i$ can be obtained.
    -   **Excess Return Form**: To better align with the CAPM's structure, regression can also be performed using excess returns:
        $R_{i,t} - R_{f,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i(R_{m,t} - R_{f,t}) + \epsilon_{i,t}$
        Where $R_{f,t}$ is the risk-free rate in period $t$, and $R_{i,t} - R_{f,t}$ and $R_{m,t} - R_{f,t}$ are the excess returns of asset $i$ and the market portfolio, respectively.
        In this form, the regressed $\alpha_i$ can be interpreted as **Jensen's alpha**, measuring the asset's abnormal return. If the CAPM holds perfectly, $\alpha_i$ should be zero.

### Economic Interpretation of the Beta Coefficient

-   **Meaning of Beta Values**:
    -   $\beta_i$ reflects the sensitivity of asset $i$ to overall market risk and is a key indicator of systematic risk.
    -   Stocks with different Beta values have different risk characteristics:
        -   **High Beta Stocks** ($\beta_i > 1$):
            -   Their returns fluctuate more than the market average; they tend to rise more when the market goes up and fall more when the market goes down.
            -   Higher risk, but also potentially higher returns.
            -   Examples: technology stocks, growth stocks.
        -   **Market-Synchronized Stocks** ($\beta_i = 1$):
            -   Their return volatility is consistent with the market average.
            -   Risk-return characteristics are similar to the market portfolio.
            -   Example: index funds.
        -   **Low Beta Stocks** ($\beta_i < 1$):
            -   Their returns fluctuate less than the market average; they tend to rise less when the market goes up and fall less when the market goes down.
            -   Lower risk, and returns are relatively stable.
            -   Examples: utility stocks, consumer staples stocks.
        -   **Negative Beta Stocks** ($\beta_i < 0$):
            -   Their returns move in the opposite direction to the market. They may fall when the market rises and rise when the market falls.
            -   Can serve as hedging instruments in a portfolio to reduce overall risk.
            -   Example: gold and other safe-haven assets (during certain specific periods).

-   **Beta and Risk Premium**:
    -   The CAPM suggests that investors receive a risk premium for bearing systematic risk. The higher the Beta coefficient, the higher the required risk premium.
    -   The market risk premium $[E(R_m) - R_f]$ is common to all assets, while $\beta_i$ represents the amount of systematic risk borne by an individual asset.
    -   Investors can adjust the risk and return profile of their portfolios by selecting assets with different Beta values.

## Empirical Testing of the CAPM Model

### Review of Empirical Testing Methods

Common empirical testing methods for the CAPM model are as follows:

1.  **Cross-Sectional Regression (or Two-Pass Regression)**
    -   Tests whether the average stock returns are linearly related to their Beta coefficients, whether $\gamma_{0,t}$ is close to the risk-free rate, and whether $\gamma_{1,t}$ is equal to the market risk premium and significantly positive.
    -   Steps:
        1.  **First Pass - Time-Series Regression to Estimate Beta**: For each asset, use a fixed time window (e.g., the past 60 months) to perform a time-series regression to estimate a single Beta value $\hat{\beta}_i$.
            Formula: $R_{i,t} - R_{f,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i (R_{m,t} - R_{f,t}) + \epsilon_{i,t}$
        2.  **Second Pass - Cross-Sectional Regression**: At each time point t, use the returns of all assets and the Betas estimated in the first pass to perform a cross-sectional regression.
            Formula: $R_{i,t} = \gamma_{0,t} + \gamma_{1,t} \hat{\beta}_i + \eta_{i,t}$

2.  **Fama-MacBeth Regression**
    -   An improved cross-sectional regression method that addresses Beta estimation errors and provides more robust estimates of risk premiums.
    -   Steps:
        1.  **First Step - Rolling Window Beta Estimation**: For each asset, use a rolling time window to estimate Beta values $\hat{\beta}_{i,t-1}$, obtaining a time series of Betas.
        2.  **Second Step - Period-by-Period Cross-Sectional Regression**: At each time point t, use current period returns and the previous period's estimated Betas for cross-sectional regression.
            Formula: $R_{i,t} = \gamma_{0,t} + \gamma_{1,t} \hat{\beta}_{i,t-1} + \eta_{i,t}$
        3.  **Third Step - Calculate Average Risk Premiums**: Calculate the time-series average of the cross-sectional regression coefficients.
            Formulas: $\bar{\gamma}_0 = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \gamma_{0,t}$ and $\bar{\gamma}_1 = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \gamma_{1,t}$
        4.  **Fourth Step - Test Significance**: Use the t-statistics of the time-series averages to test the significance of $\bar{\gamma}_0$ and $\bar{\gamma}_1$.

3.  **Portfolio Grouping Method**
    -   To address the issue of large estimation errors in individual stock Betas, researchers often use the portfolio grouping method for empirical tests.
    -   Steps:
        1.  **First Step - Estimate Individual Stock Betas**: Estimate Beta values for each stock.
        2.  **Second Step - Group by Beta Size**: Group stocks into multiple portfolios (usually 10 or 20) based on their Beta values.
        3.  **Third Step - Calculate Portfolio Characteristics**: Calculate the average Beta and average return for each portfolio.
        4.  **Fourth Step - Portfolio-Level Regression**: Perform a cross-sectional regression using the average Betas and average returns of the portfolios.
            Formula: $\overline{R}_{p} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1\overline{\beta}_p + \eta_p$
    -   This method was first proposed by Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972) and can significantly reduce the impact of Beta estimation errors on test results.

### CAPM Tests in the Chinese Market

Drawing from the reference book "Factor Investing: Methods and Practice," we can infer the test results and characteristics of the CAPM model in the Chinese market:

-   **Market Factor Remains Important**: Even in the Chinese A-share market, the market factor is still an important factor in explaining asset returns, and the CAPM model is applicable to some extent.
-   **Pricing Errors May Be Larger**: Due to the emerging market characteristics of China, relatively lower efficiency, and more market frictions, the CAPM model may exhibit larger pricing errors ($\alpha_i$ significantly different from zero).
-   **Need to Consider Other Factors**: The single-factor CAPM model may not be sufficient to fully explain asset pricing phenomena in the Chinese market. It may be necessary to consider other risk factors, such as size, value, and profitability, to build multi-factor models.
-   **Choice of Testing Methods**: More robust methods like Fama-MacBeth regression may be more suitable for the Chinese market to handle Beta estimation errors and market noise.

### Findings from Empirical Research on CAPM in the Chinese Market

-   **CAPM Has Some Explanatory Power in the Chinese Market, but Less Than in Mature Markets**: Market risk is an important factor affecting the returns of Chinese A-shares, but the explanatory power of the CAPM model is relatively limited.
-   **Market Anomalies Are More Pronounced in the Chinese Market**: Market anomalies such as the size effect, value effect, and momentum effect may be more significant in the Chinese market, and the CAPM model struggles to explain these phenomena.
-   **Multi-Factor Models Are More Applicable in the Chinese Market**: To more accurately describe asset pricing in the Chinese market, it is necessary to construct multi-factor models that incorporate more risk factors.
-   **Market Efficiency Needs Improvement**: The efficiency of the Chinese A-share market is relatively low. Market frictions and investor behavioral biases may lead to deviations in CAPM pricing.

## Limitations of the CAPM Model

Although the CAPM model is a cornerstone of asset pricing theory, it has many limitations in practical application. Understanding these limitations helps us use the model more reasonably and recognize the necessity for the development of subsequent models.

-   **Limitations of a Single-Factor Model**:
    -   **Considers Only Market Risk**: The CAPM model only considers the market portfolio as the single systematic risk factor. However, in reality, multiple risk factors may affect asset returns, such as:
        -   **Size Risk**: Small-cap companies may face greater operational and liquidity risks.
        -   **Value Risk**: Value companies (high book-to-market ratio) may face risks of declining profitability.
        -   **Profitability Risk**: Companies with weaker profitability may face operational difficulties.
    -   **Cannot Explain All Return Differences**: Empirical studies show that the CAPM model cannot fully explain the return differences between various assets, leading to **pricing errors** ($\alpha_i \neq 0$).

-   **Overly Strong Assumptions about Market Efficiency**:
    -   **Markets Are Not Perfect**: Real markets have transaction costs, information asymmetry, short-selling restrictions, etc. These market frictions affect the validity of the CAPM model.
    -   **Investor Behavioral Biases**: The CAPM model assumes investors are perfectly rational. However, behavioral finance research shows that investors exhibit various irrational behavioral biases, such as overconfidence and herding effects, which also cause market pricing to deviate from CAPM predictions.

-   **Challenges in Empirical Testing**:
    -   **Market Portfolio Difficult to Define**: The market portfolio in CAPM theory includes all assets, which is difficult to define and obtain accurately in practice. Stock indices (like the CSI 300 or S&P 500) are often used as proxies, potentially leading to biased test results.
    -   **Model Assumptions Difficult to Verify**: Many CAPM assumptions (such as investor homogeneity, normal distribution of returns) are difficult to verify directly. The model's validity can only be tested indirectly.
    -   **Influence of Data and Methods**: Empirical test results can be affected by data frequency, time windows, testing methods, etc. Different studies may reach different conclusions.

-   **Inability to Explain Market Anomalies**:
    -   **Market Anomalies**: Refer to persistent excess return phenomena that the CAPM model cannot explain.
    -   Common market anomalies include:
        -   **Size Effect**: Small-cap stocks tend to have average returns significantly higher than predicted by the CAPM.
        -   **Value Effect**: Value stocks (high book-to-market ratio) tend to have average returns significantly higher than predicted by the CAPM.
        -   **Momentum Effect**: Stocks with high returns over a past period tend to continue to have high returns in the near future.
    -   The existence of market anomalies indicates that the CAPM model's description of real markets is incomplete, requiring the introduction of more risk factors or consideration of behavioral finance factors to explain these phenomena.

## Summary

-   The CAPM model is an important cornerstone of asset pricing theory, providing a benchmark framework for asset pricing.
-   The CAPM model assumes that investors are rational, markets are efficient, and asset prices fully reflect all available information.
-   The CAPM model has numerous limitations in practical application. Understanding these limitations helps us use the model more reasonably and recognize the necessity for the development of subsequent models.
